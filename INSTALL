Rmlx Installation Guide
========================

Rmlx can use either a system-installed MLX library or build from bundled source.
By default, it searches for system MLX first and falls back to building from source.

Default Installation
--------------------

The default installation searches for system MLX in standard locations
(/opt/homebrew, /usr/local). If not found, it builds from bundled source:

```r
install.packages("Rmlx", type = "source")
```

When building from source, backends are auto-detected:
- **macOS (Apple Silicon)**: Builds Metal + CPU backends
- **Linux**: Builds CUDA + CPU backends (if CUDA toolkit is found)
- **Linux (no CUDA)**: Builds CPU-only backend


Backend Configuration Options
------------------------------

You can customize which backends to build using either configure arguments or
environment variables.

### Using configure.args

```r
# CPU-only build (no GPU acceleration)
install.packages("Rmlx", type = "source", configure.args = "--cpu-only")

# Force CUDA on Linux (requires CUDA toolkit)
install.packages("Rmlx", type = "source", configure.args = "--with-cuda")

# Disable Metal on macOS (CPU-only)
install.packages("Rmlx", type = "source", configure.args = "--without-metal")

# Multiple options
install.packages("Rmlx",
                 type = "source",
                 configure.args = c("--with-cpu", "--without-cuda"))
```

### Using Environment Variables

```r
# From R
Sys.setenv(MLX_BUILD_CUDA = "OFF")
Sys.setenv(MLX_BUILD_CPU = "ON")
install.packages("Rmlx", type = "source")

# From shell
MLX_BUILD_CUDA=OFF R CMD INSTALL Rmlx_*.tar.gz
```

### Available Options

Configure arguments:
  --with-cuda          Enable CUDA backend (Linux only)
  --without-cuda       Disable CUDA backend
  --with-metal         Enable Metal backend (macOS only)
  --without-metal      Disable Metal backend
  --with-cpu           Enable CPU backend
  --without-cpu        Disable CPU backend
  --cpu-only           Build CPU-only version (shortcut)
  --help               Show configuration help

Environment variables (MLX library source):
  MLX_USE_SYSTEM=1           Force use of system MLX
  MLX_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=1    Force build from bundled source
  MLX_INCLUDE=/path          Path to MLX headers (implies system MLX)
  MLX_LIB_DIR=/path          Path to MLX libraries (implies system MLX)

Environment variables (bundled MLX build):
  MLX_BUILD_CUDA=ON|OFF      Control CUDA backend
  MLX_BUILD_METAL=ON|OFF     Control Metal backend
  MLX_BUILD_CPU=ON|OFF       Control CPU backend


Using System MLX
----------------

By default, configure searches for system MLX in /opt/homebrew and /usr/local.
To install system MLX on macOS:

```bash
brew install mlx
```

If configure doesn't auto-detect your system MLX, specify paths explicitly:

```r
# From R
Sys.setenv(MLX_INCLUDE = "/opt/homebrew/include")
Sys.setenv(MLX_LIB_DIR = "/opt/homebrew/lib")
install.packages("Rmlx", type = "source")
```

From shell:
```bash
MLX_INCLUDE=/opt/homebrew/include R CMD INSTALL Rmlx_*.tar.gz
```

Building from Bundled Source
------------------------------

To force building from bundled source even if system MLX is available:

```r
# From R
Sys.setenv(MLX_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE = "1")
install.packages("Rmlx", type = "source")
```

From shell:
```bash
MLX_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=1 R CMD INSTALL Rmlx_*.tar.gz
```


System Requirements
-------------------

### All Platforms
- CMake 3.24 or later
- C++17 compatible compiler

### macOS
- macOS 13.5 or later
- Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3, or later)
- Xcode Command Line Tools

Install requirements:
```bash
xcode-select --install
brew install cmake
```

### Linux
- BLAS, LAPACK, and LAPACKE libraries (required)
- CUDA Toolkit 12.0 or later (optional, for GPU acceleration)
- NVIDIA GPU with compute capability 7.0+ (for CUDA)

Install requirements (Ubuntu/Debian):
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cmake build-essential libblas-dev liblapack-dev liblapacke-dev

# For CUDA support (optional)
# Download from https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
```

**Note**: BLAS, LAPACK, and LAPACKE are always required on Linux, even for CPU-only builds.
For CPU-only builds on Linux, CUDA is not required.


Examples
--------

### macOS with default settings
```r
# Builds Metal + CPU backends
install.packages("Rmlx", type = "source")
```

### Linux with CUDA
```r
# Auto-detects CUDA if available
install.packages("Rmlx", type = "source")

# Or explicitly enable
install.packages("Rmlx", type = "source", configure.args = "--with-cuda")
```

### Linux without CUDA (CPU-only)
```r
install.packages("Rmlx", type = "source", configure.args = "--cpu-only")
```

### Development installation
```r
# Install from GitHub
remotes::install_github("hughjonesd/Rmlx", configure.args = "--cpu-only")

# Or clone and install locally
# git clone https://github.com/hughjonesd/Rmlx.git
# cd Rmlx
# R CMD INSTALL . --configure-args="--cpu-only"
```


Troubleshooting
---------------

### CMake not found
Install CMake using your system package manager or from https://cmake.org/

### CUDA errors on Linux
If you see CUDA-related errors but don't have CUDA installed:
```r
install.packages("Rmlx", type = "source", configure.args = "--without-cuda")
```

### Build takes too long
The first installation compiles the MLX library, which can take 5-15 minutes
depending on your system. Subsequent reinstalls will be faster if you don't
clean the build artifacts.

### Out of memory during compilation
Reduce parallel build jobs by setting:
```bash
MAKEFLAGS="-j2" R CMD INSTALL Rmlx_*.tar.gz
```
