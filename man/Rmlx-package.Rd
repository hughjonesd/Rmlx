\title{Rmlx: R Interface to Apple's MLX Arrays}
\description{
This package provides an R interface to Apple's \href{https://mlx-framework.org/}{MLX}
(Machine Learning eXchange) library for GPU-accelerated array operations on
Apple Silicon.
}
\section{Key Features}{
\itemize{
\item Lazy evaluation: Operations are not computed until explicitly evaluated
\item GPU acceleration: Leverage Metal on Apple Silicon
\item Familiar syntax: S3 methods for standard R operations
\item Unified memory: Efficient data sharing between CPU and GPU
}
}

\section{Lazy Evaluation}{
MLX arrays use lazy evaluation by default. Operations are recorded but not
executed until:
\itemize{
\item You call \code{\link[=mlx_eval]{mlx_eval()}}
\item You convert to R with \code{\link[=as.matrix]{as.matrix()}} or \code{\link[=as.vector]{as.vector()}}
\item The result is needed for another computation
}

The package implements most of the C++ API via calls with the \code{mlx_} prefix,
but it also ships \link[=mlx-methods]{S3 methods for many base generics},
so common R matrix operations continue to work on MLX arrays. R conventions
are used throughout: for example, indexing is 1-based.
