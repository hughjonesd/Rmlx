\title{Subset MLX array}
\usage{
\method{[}{mlx}(x, ...) <- value

\method{[}{mlx}(x, ..., drop = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An mlx array, or an R array/matrix/vector that will be converted via \code{\link[=as_mlx]{as_mlx()}}.}

\item{...}{Indices for each dimension. Provide one per axis; omitted indices
select the full extent. Logical indices recycle to the dimension length.}

\item{drop}{Should dimensions be dropped? (default: FALSE)}
}
\value{
The subsetted MLX object.
}
\description{
MLX subsetting mirrors base R for the common cases while avoiding a few of
the language's historical footguns:
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \strong{Numeric indices}: positive (1-based) and purely negative vectors are
supported. Negative indices drop the listed elements, just as in base R.
Mixing signs is an error and \code{0} is not allowed.
\item \strong{Logical indices}: recycled to the target dimension length. Logical masks
may be mixed with numeric indices across dimensions.
\item \strong{Matrices/arrays}: numeric matrices (or higher dimensional arrays) select
individual elements, one coordinate per row. The trailing dimension must
match the array rank and entries must be positive; negative matrices are
rejected to avoid ambiguous complements.
\item \strong{\code{mlx} indices}: \code{mlx} vectors, logical masks, and matrices behave the
same as their R equivalents. One-dimensional MLX arrays are treated as
vectors rather than 1-column matrices.
\item \strong{\code{drop}}: dimensions are preserved by default (\code{drop = FALSE}), matching
the package's preference for explicit shapes.
\item \strong{Unsupported}: character indices and named lookups are not implemented.
