\usage{
mlx_conv_transpose3d(
  input,
  weight,
  stride = c(1L, 1L, 1L),
  padding = c(0L, 0L, 0L),

}
\arguments{
\item{input}{Input mlx array. Shape depends on dimensionality (see individual functions).}

\item{weight}{Weight array. Shape depends on dimensionality (see individual functions).}

\item{stride}{Stride of the convolution. Can be a scalar or vector (length depends
on dimensionality). Default: 1 for 1D, c(1,1) for 2D, c(1,1,1) for 3D.}

\item{padding}{Amount of zero padding. Can be a scalar or vector (length depends
on dimensionality). Default: 0 for 1D, c(0,0) for 2D, c(0,0,0) for 3D.}

\item{dilation}{Spacing between kernel elements. Can be a scalar or vector (length
depends on dimensionality). Default: 1 for 1D, c(1,1) for 2D, c(1,1,1) for 3D.}

\item{output_padding}{Additional size added to output shape. Can be a scalar or
length-3 vector. Default: c(0, 0, 0)}

\item{groups}{Number of blocked connections from input to output channels. Default: 1.}

\item{device}{Device for computation: \code{"gpu"} or \code{"cpu"}. Default: \code{mlx_default_device()}.}
}
\value{
An mlx array with the transposed convolution result
}
\description{
Applies a 3D transposed convolution (also called deconvolution) over an input signal.
Useful for 3D volumetric data upsampling, such as in medical imaging or video generation.
}
\details{
Input has shape \verb{(batch, depth, height, width, in_channels)} for 'NDHWC' layout.
Weight has shape \verb{(out_channels, kernel_d, kernel_h, kernel_w, in_channels)}.
