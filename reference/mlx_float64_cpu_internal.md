# Float64 creation and conversion note

Float64 creation and conversion note

## Details

MLX does not support `float64` operations on GPU. When this function
creates a `float64` array or converts one back to R, Rmlx temporarily
switches only that internal creation or layout work to CPU. Later
operations on the returned array still use the current
[`mlx_device()`](https://hughjonesd.github.io/Rmlx/reference/mlx_device.md).
